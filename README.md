# Sequence-Alignment

Sequence Alignment is performed on DNA strands, RNA strands and proteins. 
Global Alignment is performed using Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm, Local Alignment is performed using Smith-Waterman Algorithm and 
Dove-tail Alignment is obtained by tweaking Local Alignment method. The top k scores are reported along with the aligned sequences and their starting and ending positions using Priority Queue Data. Code is written in Java and helper functions for reading the input sequences used Java 8 features.
